# TinyC-Compiler
The aim of the project was to build a compiler for a subset of C language, thereby applying the concepts of Formal
Language and Automata Theory. Developed as part of laboratory coursework for Compilers Lab course (CS39003-
Autumn 2020) of CSE department at IIT Kharagpur.
The compiler is developed in phases: User-dened Library, Lexical Analyser, Parser, Intermediate Code Generator
(Three Address Code), Target Code Generator (x86 Assembly). The nal developed compiler convert the source
code to target assembly code.
